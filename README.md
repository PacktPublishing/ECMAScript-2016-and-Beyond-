## About the Video Course
	ECMAScript (or ES) is created to standardize JavaScript, so as to foster multiple independent implementations. 
This course will benefit developers familiar with language developments in JavaScript. In this course, we take a look at what the ECMAScript 2016 and ECMAScript 2017 versions bring to the table. Also, this course focuses on how to use the new language development and new features today in your projects. 
This course begins by explaining the features of ECMAScript 2016 and 2017. Later it delves into the usage of ES6 in today's world. You will also learn how to work with Babel and Traceur, and how they can be put to best use. 
By the end of this course, you will be completely exposed to ECMAScript and will be able to use it in the most efficient way.
